Imagine the club is very heavy and how that would straighten and extend your arms away rather than them buckling and wrapping around your body.\

To help with this, focus on your **chest** â€“ keeping it pointing down towards where the ball was for as long as possible.\

You should feel your forearms starting to rotate at around the **hip level** on the downswing and they should continue to rotate through to the hip level of your follow through. At this point you should see the **right hand is on top of your left** (vice versa for left-handed golfers) and the badge on your glove should be facing the ground.
