    #### Types of Golf Grip

    There are 3 main golf grips:-

    *   [![Types of golf grips - overlap grip, interlock grip, baseball grip](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/proper-golf-grip-types-overlap-interlock-baseball-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/proper-golf-grip-types-overlap-interlock-baseball.png)The fingers of the right hand can grip the club and link with the left hand in 3 different ways – referred to as the **interlinking** grip, the **overlapping** or ‘Vardon’ grip and the **baseball** grip.\


        ***
    *   [![Interlock golf grip (interlinking grip)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/proper-golf-grip-type-interlock-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/proper-golf-grip-type-interlock.png)It’s a common misconception amongst amateur golfers that the interlinking grip is predominantly used by ladies and juniors. Both Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods use the interlinking grip.\


        ***
    *   [![Overlap grip and interlock grip are recommended over the baseball grip](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/proper-golf-grip-types-recommended-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/proper-golf-grip-types-recommended.png)I recommend you use either the interlinking or overlapping grip – whichever you find more comfortable.\

    #### Grip pressure – How hard should you grip the golf club?

    *   [![Proper golf grip pressure](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/proper-golf-grip-pressure-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/proper-golf-grip-pressure.png)You’ll often hear that gripping the club tightly causes tension in the body, which in turn hinders your ability to make a good swing. However, gripping the club with a lot of pressure at the point of impact will help you to better control the strike.\


        ***
    *   On a scale of 1 to 10, imagine that a level 10 equates to gripping the club as tightly as possible. A level 1 equates to holding the club so loosely it only just stays in your hands.\


        ***
    * [![At address, grip the club lightly in your hands](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/proper-golf-grip-pressure-address-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/proper-golf-grip-pressure-address.png)
    *   At address, hold the club with a grip pressure of 4 out of 10.\


        ***
    * At impact, your grip pressure should increase to a 9 or even a 10 out of 10. You might want to consciously grasp the club more tightly at impact to see how that effects your ball striking.
