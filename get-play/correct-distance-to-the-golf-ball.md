### Distance To The Golf Ball – Video Summary

*   [![Step 1: Stand with your legs extended and your weight a little back towards your heels](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/distance-to-golf-ball-1-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/distance-to-golf-ball-1.png)Address the golf ball and lock your knees – so there is no flex in your knees at all. You should feel your weight shift towards your heels.\

*   Now, just flex your knees slightly until you feel your weight shift from your heels towards the balls of your feet. When you feel your weight is balanced over the centre of your feet, that’s enough knee flex.\

*   Take the chosen club and lower it onto your front thigh. The club should touch about **1 inch** above your kneecap. If this doesn’t happen, alter your distance to the golf ball as necessary.\
