## Neutral  Grip （left hand)

A neutral grip means that those ‘V’ shapes are pointed up toward your nose. As the name states, this grip would be ideal for someone who hits the ball fairly straight or even likes to play both shot shapes on the course.

## Strong grip（left hand)

A strong grip means that the ‘V’ shapes made with your thumbs and your hands are pointing somewhere to the right side of your head. This is generally how I direct my students to grip the club. A strong grip can cure someone who swings over the top and/or struggles with slicing the ball.



## Weak grip（left hand)

A weak grip means the ‘V’ shapes are pointed to the left of your head. This type of grip would promote a less closed club face through impact as well as a more out-to-in swing. A weaker grip can help players who struggle with hooked shots by promoting a club face that closes less rapidly through impact.



## Neutral  Grip （right hand)

A weak grip means left hand's the ‘V’ shapes are pointed to the middle of your head.&#x20;

## Strong grip（right hand)

A strong grip means that  left hand's  ‘V’ shapes point down to your right shoulder.&#x20;

## Properly Take Hold of the Club

### Step 1: Know That the Club Should Be Held More in the Fingers Than the Palm <a href="#mntl-sc-block_2-0-6" id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-6"></a>

![Dots on golf glove illustrate path that club is laid across the fingers](https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/m8j4wotQ279ONhbW6XQz\_ECo0RI=/673x466/filters:no\_upscale\(\):max\_bytes\(150000\):strip\_icc\(\):format\(webp\)/lead-hand-grip-dots-on-glove-587259f95f9b584db365e729.jpg)

The dots on the glove show the position the club should take in the grip. The club should be held more in the fingers than in the palm.



### Step 2: Connect the Dots <a href="#mntl-sc-block_2-0-9" id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-9"></a>

![Laying the golf club across the fingers of your top hand](https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/4RgWb9I2iCwXJlakOmCfsZuGf00=/1448x1086/filters:no\_upscale\(\):max\_bytes\(150000\):strip\_icc\(\):format\(webp\)/lead-hand-grip-2-58725a3d5f9b584db3664d23.jpg)

Hold the club about three feet in the air, in front of your body. With the clubface square, place the club at an angle through the fingers, following the line of the dots pictured in the previous image. The club should touch the base of the little finger and rest just above the first joint of the index finger (along the line of the dots).



### Step 3: Check Thumb Position <a href="#mntl-sc-block_2-0-12" id="mntl-sc-block_2-0-12"></a>

With the club at an angle and in the fingers, place your left thumb (for right-handed players) toward the back side of the shaft.

### Step 4: Check Knuckles and 'V' Position

In the [address](https://www.tripsavvy.com/golf-setup-position-1564424) position, looking down at your grip, you should be able to see the knuckles of the index and middle finger of your lead (top) hand.

You should also see a "V" that is created by the thumb and forefinger of the lead hand, and that "V" should be pointing back toward your right (for right-handed players) shoulder (the one o'clock position).

Finally, complete the grip by placing your trailing (bottom) hand on the handle.

### Separate the index finger

Separate the index finger to create a V between the thumb and index finger to allow us to create a resting resting point for the golf club once we  hit very top of the back swing.&#x20;
