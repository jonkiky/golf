We’ve already covered the [correct distance to the golf ball](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/fundamental-golf-tips/golf-set-up-tips/correct-distance-to-the-golf-ball/) and a quick test that you can use to make sure you’re not setting up too close or too far away. If you haven’t seen that yet, check out part 3 of this mini series.

The video below looks at the ideal golf ball position **between your feet**– whether the ball should sit centrally between your feet or closer to your left or right foot.



### Golf Ball Position – Video Summary

* [![Ball position for wedges](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/golf-ball-position-wedge-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/golf-ball-position-wedge.png)
*   Take your correct [width of stance](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/fundamental-golf-tips/golf-set-up-tips/proper-golf-stance/) and place a club directly in the centre, at right angles to the ball-to-target line. This central position is the ideal position for the shortest clubs in your bag – lob wedge, sand wedge, gap wedge, pitching wedge etc. It helps us to hit down on the ball creating more backspin.\

So a 7 iron for example, would be played a couple of inches off centre, towards your front foot.\

This allows us to sweep the ball away rather than hitting down on it.\
