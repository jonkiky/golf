*   [![There should be no wrist hinge during the takeaway](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/golf-takeaway-no-wrist-hinge-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/golf-takeaway-no-wrist-hinge.png)Start the takeaway by allowing your left shoulder to turn under your chin (for the right-handed golfer). Keep the left arm straight and the hands passive (no wrist hinge or rotation at this stage) until the club reaches hip height.\

*   [![Your club should point straight at the target in the takeaway (when club is parallel to the ground)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/golf-takeaway-club-point-at-target-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/golf-takeaway-club-point-at-target.png)As the club reaches a horizontal position, check that the butt end of the club points at your target. If you have access to a mirror use the down the line view to check that the club is in this position.\

* The club head should cover the view of your hands. Looking down the line, the sole of the club should run parallel to your spine angle.

You can easily practice a good golf swing takeaway at home or at work with a spare club. You want it to become second nature so that on the golf course you donâ€™t think consciously about checkpoints or swing paths.

I recommend that for 7-10 days you make 15-20 good takeaways 3x a day. Combine this with checking your [set up position](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/fundamental-golf-tips/golf-set-up-tips/) before each takeaway swing.
