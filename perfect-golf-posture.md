4.  Tilt forwards making sure you tilt at the **hips only**. Your lower back should remain flat rather than rounded. Feel like you are pushing your behind backwards (Photo #2).\

6. As the club lowers to touch the ground behind the ball, flex your knees slightly (Photo 3). Avoid making the mistake of many amateur golfers by over-bending your knees.
