### Golf Impact Position – Video Summary

*   [![At impact, the clubface should be square to the target and the swing path should be square as well](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/golf-impact-clubface-clubpath-square-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/golf-impact-clubface-clubpath-square.png)If you’ve followed the previous videos and drills in this series, the golf club should be moving along the right path into the ball and the club face should be aiming in the right direction.\

*   [![The club should head into impact at the right height (below the equator) and strike the ball first (not the ground)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/golf-impact-clubhead-correct-height-288x288.png)](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/golf-impact-clubhead-correct-height.png)The golf club should be coming down at the right height. It should not strike the top of the golf ball but rather towards its bottom. You also need to be careful that the club doesn’t strike the ground before the golf ball, which will produce a [fat shot](https://free-online-golf-tips.com/fix-golf-faults/anti-fat-tips/).\

The head is looking back towards the back of the golf ball.\
